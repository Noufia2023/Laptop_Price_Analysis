# Laptop_Price_Analysis
This project will help us to understand how to analyze and predict laptop prices using a dataset containing laptop specifications.
It is a simple regression task where we predict the price of a laptop based on its features like brand, processor, RAM, storage, etc.
Given dataset: laptop_prices.csv
Number of rows: 1275
Number of columns: 23
Handled missing values
Convert categorical data to numerical using One-hot encoding
Used Linear Regression and RandomForestRegressor models.
Use train-test split to evaluate the model(X_train, X_test, y_train,   y_test).
Handles numeric and categorical features automatically with a pipeline.
Fit pipeline on X_train, y_train
Predict on X_test
Evaluate and visualize.
RandomForestmodel gives the best RÂ² performance
scikit- learn (sklearn) library is used for Machine learning and Modeling.
